            <p>In 2019, I came to Nanjing University in China to study Public Administration. I graduated in June 2023 with honors as an outstanding graduate. During these four years, I learned about public administration, public economics, public finance, and philanthropy, and I became proficient in quantitative methods in the field of social sciences. After that, I developed an interest in computer science, which led me to come to Vancouver, Canada, to study the CS Align program at Northeastern University.</p>

            <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
            <p>When I'm not buried in work or studies I enjoy reading, drawing, playing guitar, photography, and traveling. Back in my undergrad days at Nanjing University, I had the fun job of leading the Photography Association, where I organized all sorts of creative outings. I have two adorable pets: a corgi named Cookie üê∂ and a tiny rabbit named Pipi üê∞. I have a soft spot for all things cute and cuddly!</p>
